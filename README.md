Hi üëã, I am a Software Engineer üë®‚Äçüíª, I love distributed systems.

## My Experience
### GitHub <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35250507/213904052-e1df66a7-50b7-499d-84ab-659a5f8b6f28.png" width="16.5">
**[Oct 2021 - May 2023]**

****End user features****
- I introduced WebAuthn functionality, allowing users to enhance account security with options like Touch-id, Security key etc. This Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) feature increased 2FA adoption rates from 8% to 13%.
- I streamlined and expedited the Two-Factor Authentication setup process, reducing its duration by nearly 50%.
- I contributed to backend modifications for npm CLI login and publish commands, ensuring compatibility with WebAuthn. This enables users to utilize their WebAuthn-registered devices via the CLI.
- I revamped the npm CLI login and publish commands, transitioning from CLI-based to web browser-based authentication. This innovation eliminates the need for repetitive username and password entries, significantly expediting the login and publishing process.
- I redesigned the password reset process from scratch, replacing a complex and error-prone 10-step flow. The new design incorporates enhanced security through a 2FA check.
- I developed a cost-effective and scalable solution for refreshing OAuth tokens for Twitter and GitHub accounts. These tokens are employed in automating the account recovery feature, resulting in a 50% reduction in account recovery time.

****SLO and Infra and Security improvements****
- I implemented a new password hashing technique for enhanced account security.
- Ireduceddatabaseloadbynearly50%byOptimisingthecomplexSQLquery through indexing.
- I migrated 20+ AWS lambdas from Node.js 14 to Node.js 16, rigorously testing and analyzing performance.
- I resolved 5xx errors in micro-services, achieving a 99.99 Service Level Objective (SLO).
- I fortified our cloud infrastructure with a policy-based Just-in-Time Access layer, enhancing security and access control.
- I handled on-call incidents and conducted root cause analyses for prompt issue resolution.
